# Integration Test Configuration
#
# Integration tests run against a stable staging environment with hardcoded test data.
# NO CONFIGURATION REQUIRED to run the tests!
#
# Simply run: npm run test:integration
#
# The staging environment contains stable test collections:
# - test_collection_1: Regular collection with 2 items in en-US and es-ES
# - test_singleton_2: Singleton collection with 1 item in en-US and es-ES
#
# All test data, IDs, and expected values are hardcoded in tests/integration/testData.ts

# STAGING ENVIRONMENT (HARDCODED)
# ============================================
# Tests always run against this stable staging environment.
# You do not need to set any variables - they are here for reference only.
